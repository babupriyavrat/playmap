A javascript libary enabling geographical data to be displayed along time. There are three types of players:
- Continuous Replay, as a video player, with the possibility to play, pause, accelerate, repeat, etc... Enables marker and geometries animations with interpolation between positions and traces as options.
- Continuous Real Time display, markers and geometries are refreshed in Real Time
- Discrete Display, markers and geometries are displayed according to a time filter
The overlays used are highly customisable providing for various possible effects.

Examples provided:
- [satellite orbits (replay and RT)](http://demos.metaaps.com/playMap/examples/continuous.html)
- [World population statistics over time (discrete)](http://demos.metaaps.com/playMap/examples/discrete.html)

**None of these examples have been tested in IE**
**There is a canvas text rendering issue in Chrome on the World Population Statistics example**

More doc coming soon, please bear with me...
